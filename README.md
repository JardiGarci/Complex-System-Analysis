**Repository Overview: Topological and Fractal Analysis Tools**  

This repository provides Python scripts for advanced image and signal analysis, focusing on **topological feature extraction** and **fractal/multifractal characterization**.  

1. **`Topology.py`** – Analyzes grayscale images using persistent homology to identify connected components and holes, tracking their persistence across intensity levels. Useful for shape analysis, medical imaging, and material science.  

2. **`Complex_Systems.py`** – Offers tools for fractal and multifractal analysis, including noise generation (white, Brownian, fractional Gaussian), Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), Higuchi fractal dimension, and Hurst exponent calculation. Supports 1D signals and 2D images, with visualization for scaling laws and multifractal spectra.  

**Applications**: Image segmentation, complex pattern analysis, time series forecasting, and synthetic data generation. Ideal for researchers in computational physics, bioimaging, and environmental science.
